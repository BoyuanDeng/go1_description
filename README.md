# go1_description

The most concise description file of go1, for use go1_robot in raisim. 

Modifications are made based on the go1 robot description of Yushu Company, in order to adapt to the requirements of rl_locomotion on the raisim version.

If you want to use it, feel free to add it directly to 
```
~/raisim/rsc/
```

`tips:`

If you are compiling the rl_locomotion library, don't forget to modify the path of a1 in the `environment.hpp` file, like `~/go1/urdf/go1.urdf`
